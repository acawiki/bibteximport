 Installation Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirement
~~~~~~~~~~~
No specific operating system are needed.

phpBIB v1.0a is written  in PHP4. Thus, PHP >=  4.3  is required on  your server
(may be old   version are supported,  but  not currently tested), and   no other
modules/extensions/library or software are  needed. PHP is free and downloadable
from http://www.php.net/downloads.php. Then,  using  a  normal browser you   can
render your bibliography. 

If you want    to customize this package  to   your own purpose  a   minimal PHP
knowledge are needed, and of course some BibTeX syntax too.  


Downloads
~~~~~~~~~
This is the first release of phpBIB, which was available at http://dfolio.free.fr


Intall
~~~~~~
I assume you get  the package and it  is named phpbib-XX.[zip|tar.gz]  where  XX
denotes a version number.  Thus running the following command  where you want to
install this package: 

% unzip -d phpbib-XX.zip
or
% tar -xvzf phpbib-XX.tar.gz

should create a directory named phpbib-XX containing the following files:
    * lang/: contains suported language
    * bibtexParser.php: provide the BibTexParser class
    * constants.php: define constant (should customize)
    * references.bib:a sample BibTeX file
    * references.css: the cascading style sheet
    * references.php: a sample file to include into your web page.
    * README
    * LICENSE

Then use references.php to include bibliogrpahy on your web page

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Security
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 In order to improve the security  you must specify a secure '.htaccess' in each
directory where you don't want to be accessible by 'visitor', which may contains
somethings like: 
   Order allow,deny
   Allow from all

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Many writer may  use  of BibTeX for   maintaining a comprehensive  bibliography
which they can then draw on at will when writing  papers. There are some usefull
tools to produce some HTML/XML documents from a BibTeX file, such as:
    * bibtex2html written in Objective Caml, by Jean-Christophe Filliâtre and
      Claude Marché.
    * bibtex2html written in C, by Grégoire Malandain.
    * bibtex2html (based on bibtexml), by Sara E. Sprenkle.
    * ... and so on ...

However,  this kind of approach is  limited insofar as  you need to rebuild your
documents each time you have new bibliography entries. 

The purpose of phpBIB is to include easily bibliography into  your web page from
BibTeX bibliography file, and to provide access to the BibTeX entries by several
criteria: year  of publication, category of  publication, keywords, author name,
from an index page. 

Moreover, with  cache control (not yet included  in this package) you can manage
your generated document. 

In addition you can easily customize the  output defining some start/end tag and
using cascading style sheet (CSS).
